#Analysis of School Performance Data

In this analysis, we collected data from two different sources and merged them into one dataset for a more insightful analysis. We began with a district summary, calculating general information from our overall data, including total number of schools, students, budget, math and reading scores, as well as overall scores and averages.

Following the district summary, we analyzed the data for each individual school, providing a more thorough view of each school's performance. This included displaying the top 5 schools and the bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rate.

Additionally, we continue analyzing the math and reading average scores by grades in each school. We then correlated this information by analyzing scores against spending per student, school size, and school type.

#Key Findings:

  School Performance by Type:
A noticeable trend is that the highest-performing schools are charter schools, while the lowest-performing schools are district schools.

  Budget per Student:
Surprisingly, there isn't a direct relationship between the budget per student and overall passing rates. Schools with the lowest budget per student actually have the highest overall passing rates.

  School Size:
Schools with a larger number of students tend to have lower overall passing rates compared to schools with smaller or medium-sized student populations. The difference is approximately 31% to 32%.

#Conclusion:

Through our analysis, we have gained valuable insights into the factors affecting school performance. While charter schools generally outperform district schools, factors such as budget per student and school size play complex roles in determining overall success. These findings can inform future decision-making and resource allocation to improve educational outcomes.
